# Unemployment-Analysis
Description:

This repository delves into an exploration of unemployment rates in India during the first 11 months of 2020 (January to October). The analysis leverages a dataset containing state-level unemployment data, including estimated unemployment rates, employment figures, and labor participation rates.

Key Findings:

Regional Variations: The North region exhibits the highest average unemployment rate, while the Northeast region boasts the lowest.
State-Level Differences: Haryana experiences the most significant unemployment burden, whereas Meghalaya enjoys the lowest average rate.
Monthly Fluctuations: The number of employed individuals fluctuates throughout the year, suggesting potential seasonal trends.
Analysis Approach:

Data Import and Cleaning:

The Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv dataset is imported.
Column names are clarified for better readability.
Missing values and data quality are assessed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The dataset is transformed to create new features, such as month names and integers for easier analysis.
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) are calculated to understand the distribution of unemployment rates.
Data visualizations, including bar charts and pair plots, are employed to reveal trends and relationships between variables.
State-Wise Analysis:

Average unemployment rates are calculated for each state and visualized using a bar chart.
The states with the highest and lowest unemployment rates are identified.
Region-Wise Analysis:

Similar to the state analysis, average unemployment rates are computed for each region and visualized.
The regions with the most and least severe unemployment are highlighted.
Month-Wise Analysis:

The number of employed individuals across months is investigated to uncover potential seasonal patterns.
A bar chart or animation is used to illustrate these trends.
Further Exploration:

Investigate correlations between unemployment rates and other economic or social factors (e.g., GDP, demographics).
Analyze data from a broader timeframe to gain a more comprehensive understanding of unemployment trends.
Employ machine learning techniques to predict future unemployment rates or identify key drivers of unemployment.
Tools and Technologies:

Python programming language
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express
Data format: CSV
